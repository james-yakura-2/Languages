Test specification has lambda expressions resolve in FIFO order, meaning that Lambda("x", Lambda ("y", (*function goes here*) ))) will be read as a function of the type y -> (x -> ?). Currently, they resolve in LIFO order, meaning that that expression is read as x -> (y -> ?). This causes a fail on test 2 of Dynamic Typing. Have included a modified version of that test that uses LIFO inputs.
Dynamic type checker must run after attempting to evaluate functions or results, due to loss of strong typing. Because of this, an evaluation failure takes precedence. This caused a fail on test 6 of Dynamic Typing until variable lookup was patched to be treated as a type error rather than an evaluation error.
